</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><strong>This is a PwnLab:init challenge from vulnhub.com. You can obtain the virtual
machine from: <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pwnlab-init,158/o">here</a></strong></p>
<p>'''
The target is flag: /root/flag.txt
'''</p>
<p>Target machine discovery:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/1_host_discovery.png" /></p>
<p>This is what we've got when browse the web server:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/2_web.png" /></p>
<p>Nikto scan on the target web server:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/3_nikto.png" /></p>
<p>At this point i search for exploits for the target version of apache and mysql,
tried to enumerate usernames, tried to bruteforce root and admin accounts, tried
to load upload page without beeing logged in all without success. Finaly able
to move forward with LFI on page parameter in the url. This cheat sheet helped
me <a href="https://highon.coffee/blog/lfi-cheat-sheet/">link</a></p>
<p>This is what we used from the cheat sheet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://192.168.155.131/fileincl/example1.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../etc/passwd
</pre></div>


<p>We coudn't able to read the passwd file but we know there is config.php (from 
the nikto scan) and got it's content with this request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://10.0.0.141/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/4_resp_base64.png" /></p>
<p>This is the base64 decoded content:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/5_decode.png" /></p>
<p>So now we have the credentials for MySql database Users lets see what's there:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mysql -h 10.0.0.141 -u root -p Users
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/6_mysql.png" /></p>
<p>The Users database happend to be base64 encode which is great news for as. After
easily decode the hashes(using owasp zap module) we logged as mike and got us 
redirect to upload page. After we're logged in the plan is to obtain
shell to the system.</p>
<p>There is some type of filter mechanism in place on uplad page allowed us to
upload only images:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/7_filter.png" /></p>
<p>I tried to bypass file type filter with various methods including change of
the extension(<em>gif, </em>png, <em>img, </em>php.img etc...) embeded php in the gif, png,
img. What did work is changing the php reverse shell extension from php to gif 
entirely(filename.gif) and add GIF89A in the beggining of the file:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/8_upload_shell.png" /></p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/9_pic_uploaded.png" /></p>
<p>So now we have our reverse php shell as *.gif file in 
upload/364c09c54bad2c9b2e056dcfdab5e406.gif
We have to find a way to execute it as php.
We got the source code of the index page through our previous exploit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> http://10.0.0.141/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=indexhttp://10.0.0.141/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index  
</pre></div>


<p>And there found unimplement function about the language of the page.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/10_index.png" /></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">if (isset(</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">_COOKIE</span><span class="x">[&#39;lang&#39;]))</span>
<span class="err">{</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">    include(&quot;lang/&quot;.</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">_COOKIE</span><span class="x">[&#39;lang&#39;]);</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So the lang param in the cookie is included. We will use this lang cookie param
to execute our gif reverse shell. This is the manual crafted request to the
target web server with cookie lang=../(our php shell location) and on the left
we are ready to catch the reverse php shell from the our attacker machine with
net cat.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/11_reverse.png" /></p>
<p>Upgrade the catched shell through python:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/12_upgrade_shell.png" /></p>
<p>We tried our 3 logins from the MySql Users table and able to log in with 
kent:JWzXuBJJNy and kane:iSv5Ym2GRo. In the home folder of kane we found msgmike 
file with SuID set and owner of the file 'mike'. So we can execute msgmike file 
as our current user(kane) with the rights of user mike (this is the suid linux 
concept). </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/13_msgmike.png" /></p>
<p>Strings command on the msgmike file:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/14_strings.png" /></p>
<p>So the file when it's executed tried to cat the content of /home/mike/msg.txt.
The plan here is to replace the cat command with our crafted one, added the
malicious command to the linux $PATH variable so it will be execute first and
instead of cat the content as typical cat command do it will spawn /bin/bash (with
the rights of the user mike)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/15_change_mike.png" /></p>
<p>At the previous screenshot we do:
- create file with name cat in /tmp
- change mode of /tmp/cat to 777 all executable :D
- add /tmp on top of the $PATH variable (linux will search in /tmp first and
  there it will find our malicious cat command)
- execute ./msgmike</p>
<p>Now we are logged as mike. This is the content of /home/mike:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/16_mike_home.png" /></p>
<p>Again binary file with set suid with the owner root. 
This is strings command on the file:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/PwnLab/17_msg2root.png" /></p>
<p>This is the interesting part:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/bin/echo %s &gt;&gt; /root/messages.txt
</pre></div>


<p>The msg2root file when it's executed promp us to enter msg. This msg will be 
echo to the /root/messages.txt file.</p>
<p>We forget to remove /tmp from the $PATH lets do it:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/PwnLab/18_remove_tmp.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have typical linux cat command again. The input of the msg2root binary
isn't sanitize properly so we are able to do command injection:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/PwnLab/19_final.png" /></p>
<p>They said this challenge will be easy it's cost me around 20 hours but I was
very satisfied when finally finish it. It was nice journey thank you to vulnhub
and the author of this vm. The tricky parts are to find first LFI vulnerability
in the php, then to find a way to upload php reverse shell as img and execute it,
then to exploit set suid on the file to escalate your privelege to the owner of 
the file, then to find the command injection in the last binary.</p>
